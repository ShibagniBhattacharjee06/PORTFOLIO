## 🧠 Project Overview

This portfolio is more than a digital resume — it’s an interactive experience that introduces who I am, what I do, and how I think.

As part of my internship at **AI Wallah**, I integrated a basic **chatbot** into the site using JavaScript, adding conversational interactivity to enhance user engagement.
